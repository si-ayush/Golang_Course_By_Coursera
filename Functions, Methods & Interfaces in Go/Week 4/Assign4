Write a program which allows the user to get information about a
predefined set of animals. Three animals are predefined, cow, bird, 
and snake. Each animal can eat, move, and speak. The user can issue 
a request to find out one of three things about an animal: 1) the 
food that it eats, 2) its method of locomotion, and 3)the sound it
makes when it speaks. The following table contains the three animals
and their associated data which should be hard-coded into your program.

Your program should present the user with a prompt, “>”, to indicate 
that the user can type a request. Your program accepts one request at
a time from the user, prints out the answer to the request, and prints
out a new prompt. Your program should continue in this loop forever. 
Every request from the user must be a single line containing 2 strings.
The first string is the name of an animal, either “cow”, “bird”, or “snake”.
The second string is the name of the information requested about the animal, 
either “eat”, “move”, or “speak”. Your program should process each request by
printing out the requested data.

You will need a data structure to hold the information about each animal. 
Make a type called Animal which is a struct containing three fields:food, 
locomotion, and noise, all of which are strings. Make three methods called Eat(), 
Move(), and Speak(). The receiver type of all of your methods should be your Animal 
type. The Eat() method should print the animal’s food, the Move() method should print 
the animal’s locomotion, and the Speak() method should print the animal’s spoken sound. 
Your program should call the appropriate method when the user makes a request.


Define an interface type called Animal which describes the methods of an animal. 
Specifically, the Animal interface should contain the methods Eat(), Move(), and 
Speak(), which take no arguments and return no values. The Eat() method should 
print the animal’s food, the Move() method should print the animal’s locomotion, 
and the Speak() method should print the animal’s spoken sound. Define three types 
Cow, Bird, and Snake. For each of these three types, define methods Eat(), Move(), 
and Speak() so that the types Cow, Bird, and Snake all satisfy the Animal interface. 
When the user creates an animal, create an object of the appropriate type. Your 
program should call the appropriate method when the user issues a query command.



package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type Animal struct {
	food, loco, sound string
}

type animal_Interface interface {
	Eat()
	Move()
	Speak()
}

func (a Animal) Eat() {
	fmt.Println(a.food)
}

func (a Animal) Speak() {
	fmt.Println(a.sound)
}

func (a Animal) Move() {
	fmt.Println(a.loco)
}

func main() {
	list_ani := map[string]Animal{"bird": Animal{"worms", "fly", "peep"},
		"snake": Animal{"mice", "slither", "hiss"},
		"cow":   Animal{"grass", "walk", "moo"}}

	var objInterace animal_Interface

	for {
		var cmd, req_ani, req_ani_type string

		fmt.Println(">")
		_, err := fmt.Scan(&cmd, &req_ani, &req_ani_type)

		if err != nil {
			panic("Error")
		}

		if cmd == "newanimal" {
			list_ani[req_ani] = list_ani[req_ani_type]
			fmt.Println("Created it!")
		}

		if cmd == "query" {
			objInterace = list_ani[req_ani]
			switch req_ani_type {
			case "eat":
				objInterace.Eat()
			case "move":
				objInterace.Move()
			case "speak":
				objInterace.Speak()
			}
		}
